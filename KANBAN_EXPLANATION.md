# Kanban Board Explanation  

## **What is Kanban?**
Kanban is a **visual workflow management system** that helps teams optimize their work processes, improve efficiency, and maintain flexibility. Originally developed by Toyota for manufacturing, Kanban has become widely used in software development and Agile project management.

The core principles of Kanban include:
1. **Visualizing Work** – Representing tasks on a board for clarity.  
2. **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)** – Ensuring focus on a manageable number of tasks.  
3. **Managing Flow** – Moving tasks smoothly through different stages.  
4. **Making Process Policies Explicit** – Defining clear rules for workflows.  
5. **Continuous Improvement** – Regularly refining the process for efficiency.


## Columns and Workflow  
 **Backlog** - Pending tasks  
 **Ready** - Tasks ready for work   
 **In Progress** - Active development  
 **In Review** - Undergoing peer review  
 **Testing** - QA verification  
 **Blocked** - Dependency issues   
 **Done**- Completed work   

## **Kanban Board Overview**
Example In the AI-Finance Coach project, created a **customized Kanban board** within the Agile Task Management System. The board consists of the following columns:

| Column | Description | Example from the Assignment |
|--------|------------|---------------------------|
| **No Status** | Unassigned tasks without a defined status. | *Expense Tracking (US-003), Budget Management (US-004)* |
| **Backlog** | Tasks that have been identified but not started yet. | *User Registration (US-001), User Login (US-002)* |
| **Ready** | Tasks that are ready to be picked up by a team member. | *(Currently Empty)* |
| **In Progress** | Tasks actively being worked on. | *(Currently Empty, but intended for ongoing development tasks)* |
| **In Review** | Tasks that are completed and awaiting review. | *(Currently Empty, to be used for validation/testing)* |
| **Testing** | Tasks that have passed development and are undergoing functional or user acceptance testing. | *(Currently Empty, to be used for validation/testing)* |
| **Blocked** | Tasks that cannot progress due to dependencies, issues, or other blockers. | *(Currently Empty, to be used for validation/testing)* |
| **Done** | Tasks that have been completed, tested, and approved for deployment or usage. | *(Currently Empty, to be used for validation/testing)* |

## **How  Kanban Board Implements These Principles**
1. **Visualization** – Each task (User Story) is clearly displayed on the board with labels.  
2. **Workflow Control** – Tasks move through columns from Backlog to In Review.  
3. **Adaptability** – New tasks can be added, and priorities can change without disrupting the board.  

### **Example: Managing "User Registration" (US-001)**
- Initially placed in **Backlog**  
- Once work starts, moved to **In Progress**  
- After implementation, it will be moved to **In Review**  
- Once fully reviewed, it moves to **Done**  

This ensures smooth tracking of tasks and prevents bottlenecks in the development process.

## **Conclusion**
Kanban provides a **flexible, efficient, and visual approach** to task management. The Agile Task Management System we implemented follows these principles by breaking down tasks into manageable stages.
