#  Activity Workflow Modeling with Activity Diagrams

## Introduction
Activity diagrams model the dynamic behavior of the **AI Finance Coach** system by representing workflows involving users, system components, and AI-driven processes. These diagrams illustrate **sequential and parallel activities**, **decision points**, and **role-based swimlanes**, ensuring efficient **financial tracking, budget management, and AI-driven recommendations**.

Each workflow is **aligned with functional requirements** to ensure a seamless user experience, focusing on **real-time interactions, automation, and security**.
