# Template Analysis and Selection  

## Introduction to GitHub Project Templates  

GitHub provides multiple project templates to facilitate Agile-based software development. These templates help organize tasks, track progress, and automate workflows. selecting the right template is crucial to ensuring efficiency and alignment with Agile methodologies.  

This section explores three GitHub templatesâ€”**Basic Kanban, Automated Kanban, and Bug Triage** and evaluates their suitability for managing development tasks effectively.  


## Template Comparison  
  

| Feature              | Basic Kanban             | Automated Kanban         | Bug Triage            |
|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Columns**         | To Do, In Progress, Done | New Issues, In Progress, Done | Triage, Needs Review, Done |
| **Automation**      | None                     | Auto-moves issues based on status changes | Auto-labeling for bug reports |
| **Best for**        | Simple task tracking     | Agile workflows, Sprint tracking | Managing bug reports efficiently |
| **Issue Handling**  | Manual movement required | Issues update automatically based on progress | Auto-triage based on labels |
| **Suitability for Agile** | Moderate | High | Low |

### Explanation of Features Compared  

1. **Columns and Workflow:**  
   - **Basic Kanban** follows a traditional task management approach with simple "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns.  
   - **Automated Kanban** extends this by adding automation, dynamically moving issues through "New Issues," "In Progress," and "Done."  
   - **Bug Triage** focuses on issue management, organizing reports into "Triage," "Needs Review," and "Done."  

2. **Automation Features:**  
   - **Basic Kanban** lacks automation, requiring manual task movement.  
   - **Automated Kanban** auto-updates tasks based on status changes, making workflow management smoother.  
   - **Bug Triage** prioritizes automation for labeling and sorting bug reports.  

3. **Suitability for Agile:**  
   - **Automated Kanban** aligns best with Agile methodologies by automating issue tracking and sprint management.  
   - **Basic Kanban** provides moderate Agile support but lacks automation.  
   - **Bug Triage** is least suitable for Agile since it focuses on defect management rather than development workflows.  


## Justification for Chosen Template  

### **Selected Template: Automated Kanban**  

The **Automated Kanban** template is the most effective choice for this project due to the following reasons:  

1. **Agile-Friendly Workflow:**  
   - Automated Kanban supports Agile principles by facilitating smooth transitions between development stages.  
   - Sprint tracking is easier due to automated issue movement.  

2. **Efficiency and Automation:**  
   - Reduces manual effort in tracking and updating tasks.  
   - Ensures real-time project status updates, improving productivity.  

3. **Visibility and Task Management:**  
   - Allows better visualization of workload distribution.  
   - Helps maintain project momentum with automated task progressions.  

### **Conclusion**  

The **Automated Kanban** template was selected because it enhances workflow automation, supports Agile sprint planning, and ensures seamless task tracking. By leveraging this template, the project can benefit from a well-structured and efficient management system.
