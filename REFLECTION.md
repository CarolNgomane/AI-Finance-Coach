# Challenges Faced in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

Developing the AI Finance Coach system presents various challenges in balancing stakeholder needs, particularly considering that users must manually enter income and expenses. While the system aims to provide AI-driven financial insights, optimizing user experience, data accuracy, and engagement remains a priority. This reflection highlights key challenges encountered and how they impact system development and user adoption.

## Challenges Faced in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

### 1. Manual Data Entry Burden

One of the primary challenges is ensuring that users can manually input income and expenses efficiently. If the systemâ€™s interface is not intuitive. To address this, the system must incorporate:

- User-friendly input fields that minimize the number of steps required for data entry.
- Autocomplete and smart suggestions to reduce the effort of categorizing transactions.
- Voice input or receipt scanning as potential future enhancements to streamline manual entry.

### 2. User Engagement & Motivation

Encouraging users to consistently log their transactions manually is another challenge. Without proper engagement mechanisms, users may abandon the system over time. Strategies to improve engagement include:

- Gamification elements such as achievement badges and progress tracking for maintaining financial goals.
- Personalized reminders based on user activity patterns to prompt manual input.
- AI-generated encouragement messages that highlight financial improvements or spending insights.

### 3. Data Accuracy & Consistency

Users may enter incomplete, duplicate, or incorrect financial data, which can lead to misleading AI-driven insights. To maintain data integrity, the system must:

- Validate input fields to ensure transactions contain necessary details such as amount, category, and date.
- Provide AI-powered error detection, alerting users to potential duplicate or suspicious entries.
- Allow easy editing and reviewing of past transactions to correct mistakes.

### 4. Balancing Simplicity with Advanced Features

The system must be accessible to novice users while offering enough depth for experienced individuals who require detailed financial analytics. Key solutions include:

- Customizable dashboards where users can select either a simplified or detailed financial view.
- Progressive disclosure to show advanced analytics only when requested, preventing information overload.
- Predefined budgeting templates to assist users who may not be familiar with financial planning.

### 5. Ensuring Timely Financial Insights

Since users enter transactions manually, AI-generated financial insights must adapt dynamically without real-time transaction data from bank integrations. The system must:

- Continuously analyze user inputs and generate meaningful insights based on spending patterns.
- Provide instant feedback by updating the financial dashboard as soon as new transactions are entered.
- Use predictive analytics to anticipate spending trends and offer proactive recommendations.
